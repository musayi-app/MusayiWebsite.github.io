              <h2>Health Advise Before donating blood</h2>
              <ul>
                <li><h3>No smoking and drinking.</h3></li>
                <p> It is important to keep your body and blood clean before you donate. It is a
                  strict rule to not consume or put your body through any kind of drug abuse for 12 hours prior to your
                  blood donation period. The consumption of cigarettes and alcohol also makes your body slightly weak, which
                  can further cause complications while or after your blood donation.</p>
                  <li><h3>Keep yourself hydrated</h3></li>
                  <p>The next step to a successful donation is drinking plenty of water. Drinking water is a necessity for all
                    of us, but when you are donating this is even more true. Water hydrates your veins, making them more
                    visible to your phlebotomist and also helps your body recover after donating.</p>
                  <li><h3>Watch what you eat</h3></li>
                  <p>Iron is an important mineral your body uses to make hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is responsible for carrying
                    oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body. Eating a well-balanced diet with plenty of iron-rich
                    foods can help you store extra iron. If you do not have enough iron stored away to make up for the iron
                    you lose when donating blood, you can develop iron deficiency anemia</p>
