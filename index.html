            <h2>PROBLEM STATEMENT</h2>
            <hr>
            <p class="text">
              <span>So many people are losing their lives due to blood shortage in hospitals.</span> 
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
            <p class="text">
              Every year, thousands of Ugandans are affected by severe malaria, women bleeding after delivery, sickle cell
              anemia, traffic accidents, and other medical issues that demand blood transfusions. However, only
              0.3-0.5% of the population gives blood, which is less than half of what the World Health Organization
              recommends for maintaining a sufficient supply in blood banks and health institutions.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              In January 2018, Uganda had crisis-level blood shortages, leading to an increase in needless
              fatalities as patients lacked access to life-saving transfusions.</span>According to the Red Cross,
              the COVID-19 pandemic has decreased blood donations by about 10% overall and led to frequent
              cancellations of blood drives and staffing shortages. The organization said about 60% of its slots for
              Indiana donation appointments in the next month were unfilled. This situation did not improve at all as
              a result of the ongoing Covid 19 crisis, which made blood donation much more difficult owing to the
              inability to travel freely, as well as government limitations imposed to curb the spread of Covid 19.
            </p>
            <h2>SOLUTION</h2>
            <p class="text">
              While the current blood shortage may not be a new thing in the country,it appears that the issue may
              worsen if no action is taken. For this reason we decided to develop A blood donation app that connects
              Blood donaors to blood recipients.This app is aimmed at bridging the gap between the donors and recipients
              to sae more lives and hopefully the nation especially in times of life threatening situations that require blood transfusions.
            </p>
